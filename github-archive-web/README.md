# Analyzing GitHub Archive Data with Crate

Crate is a scalable, distributed SQL database and to show you how great it works, we have created this demo!

## Get Started

This demo can be viewed online, but you can also download the bundle as a whole and show your colleagues, boss, or significant other - whoever might be interested.

### Prerequisites
`bower` and `npm` are required to run this demo. They are available for all popular operating systems (in fact `npm` installs `bower`: http://bower.io/#install-bower)
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install

### Run
`npm start` then access http://localhost:8000
